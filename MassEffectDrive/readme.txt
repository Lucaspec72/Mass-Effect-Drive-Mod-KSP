--------------------


Hi, thank you for trying out the first version for the MEdrive mod.
This is still very much a work in progress, but should be in a mostly playable state.

Note : The mod currently uses modified variants of Stock Parts as placeholders until proper parts are added.

What's the mod, and how does it work :


This mod adds the Mass Effect Drive, a device able to warp it's vessel's mass by a percentage using a mysterious ressource called Element Zero, one that can only be found in
trace quantities on the far reaches of Eeloo.

To use the mass effect drive, you'll need three things : Element Zero, Electric Charge and Static Charge Capacitors. Element Zero is costly and difficult to obtain, but on
the upside isn't consumed by the drive. Element Zero serves as catalyst for the operation of the drive, determining the Electric Charge to Warped Mass ratio. To simplify, the
more Element Zero, the better.

When The Mass Effect Drive is running, the Electric Charge consumed by it will become Static Charge, that can only be Discharged around a planet's magnetic field. It must therefore be stored in high-capacity Capacitors.

The Mass Effect Drives automatically Discharge the vessel's Static Charge Capacitors when in low-orbit of a planet, and the length of this process is determined by the distance to the planet.

To prevent accidently tearing the fabric of spacetime, the drive will automatically shut itself off when the vessel is altered.
